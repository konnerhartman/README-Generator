# README Generator
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
  
  ## Description
  This is an app that allows the user to quickly create high quality README files by answering a few questions in the terminal/bash. This was created with node.js and utilized the 'npm inquirer'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an individual who creates a lot of READMEs, I wanted to streamline this process without losing quality. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I built this app to eliminate the tedious process of creating a high quality README for every project I build.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While building this I had issues with getting the license badge to properlly display. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This build taught me about back-end web developement and working only with the terminal/bash.
