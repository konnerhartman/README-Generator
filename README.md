# README Generator
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
  
  ## Description
  This app was built using node.js. It is a back-end app that allows the user to create high quality README files quickly. This app uses the 'npm' package 'inquirer'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My motivation to build this app was to avoid the tedious process of having to create an enitre README file every time I build a new project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I built this app to help streamline the process of creating README files while maintaining a high quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This app will save the user time and ensure that all their README files are of the same format for consistancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While building this app I learned about back-end development, working withing the terminal/bash by using node.js, and I also learned about npm (node package manager).

  ## Installation
  To install this the user must navigate to the directory they are working in and in the command line call 'npm init', then 'npm i inquirer'.
  
  ## Usage
  This app will be used by users to optimize their time by cutting back on time spent writing a README file from scratch. This app will prompt the user with several questions and take that input and create a README file for them.
